Plan: 23-01-PLAN.md
Status: Planned; plan-checker PASS with one non-blocking execution-size warning
Last activity: 2026-05-25 - Phase 23 plan approved

## Requirements Coverage

- cumulative shipped requirements: 121 total
- v1.3 requirements archived: 20/20 complete
- v1.2 requirements archived: 24/24 complete
- v1.4 requirements: 29 total, 29 mapped, 10 complete
- blocker gaps: 0

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Continue phase numbering from v1.1 | v1.2 used Phases 12-15 |
| Choose proactive support over external channels | Trusted adult plan and mood check-ins deepen support without adding Zalo/SMS/push risk |
| Keep in-app SOS as source of truth | Mood check-ins suggest SOS but never send SOS automatically |
| Keep optional mood notes student-only by default | Adult/admin summaries exclude raw private notes |
| Preserve metadata-only operations | Operations views use safe counts/statuses only |
| Continue phase numbering from v1.2 | v1.3 uses Phases 16-20 |
| Prioritize pilot UX before new sensitive sharing features | v1.3 improves live demo readiness without expanding adult/admin access to raw private data |
| Use public landing plus one-step demo role entry | Phase 16 preserves manual login while making evaluator entry faster |
| Use global responsive/accessibility guardrails before per-page polish | Phase 17 reduces overflow/focus risks across all current and future screens |
| Make critical actions narrate consequences and outcomes | Phase 18 adds confirmation context and success/error states without expanding private data access |
| Keep live demo smoke separate from production launch readiness | Phase 19 smoke verifies deployed demo usability while `/health/ready` can remain `not_ready` until demo seeding is disabled for real production launch |
| Use ESLint flat config for Next 16 | Phase 20 replaces broken `next lint` with direct ESLint CLI and Next flat configs |
| Start v1.4 with consent and transparency before external notification channels | Reminder and access-transparency features need student control, policy defaults, and audit boundaries before adding Zalo/SMS/push |

## Known Tech Debt

- `npm --prefix frontend audit --omit=dev` reports an existing moderate Next/PostCSS advisory; `npm audit fix --force` proposes a breaking downgrade, so track until a non-breaking stable Next release resolves it.
- Deferred future work remains: notification retry queues, Zalo/SMS/push channels, selective private-note sharing, reason-for-access prompts, counselor handoff, content diff/version history, multi-school tenancy, and production OAuth/SSO.
